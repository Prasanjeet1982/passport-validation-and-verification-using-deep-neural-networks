# Passport Validation Project

This project aims to create a passport validation and verification system using deep neural networks in Python.

## Overview

The project involves the following components:

- `data_collection.py`: Script for collecting passport images and labeling the dataset.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: File for resizing, normalizing, and splitting the dataset.
- `model_architecture.py`: Contains the definition of the neural network architecture.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the neural network using the prepared dataset.
- `model_evaluation.py`: File for evaluating the trained model on test data.
- `application.py`: Code for the main application that users interact with.
- `model_integration.py`: Handles integrating the trained model into the application for validation.
- `model_improvement.py`: Script for implementing model improvements and optimizations.
- `utils.py`: File with utility functions used across multiple scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies and their versions.
- `documentation.md`: This file - providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/passport-validation.git
    cd passport-validation
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

    - Use `data_collection.py` to collect passport images.
    - Preprocess the dataset using `data_preprocessing.py`.

2. Model Training:

    - Define and train the neural network using `train_model.py`.

3. Model Evaluation and Integration:

    - Evaluate the trained model on test data using `model_evaluation.py`.
    - Integrate the model into an application using `model_integration.py`.

4. Model Improvement:

    - Experiment with model improvements using `model_improvement.py`.

### Notes

- Adjust paths, configurations, and hyperparameters based on your dataset and requirements.
- Refer to specific script files for detailed usage and functionalities.
- Use the provided utility functions in `utils.py` for common tasks.
